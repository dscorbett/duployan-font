# Font variants

The Duployan font family has multiple variants:

* Duployan
* Duployan Unjoined
* Noto Sans Duployan
* Noto Sans Duployan Unjoined
* Duployan Test
* Duployan Test Unjoined

By default, the font supports cursive joining and contextual forms. The
“Unjoined” fonts remove those features for compatibility with software in which
the main fonts do not work.

The Noto variants exclude certain characters which are inappropriate or
unnecessary for inclusion in the Noto project’s Duployan font. The canonical
Noto Sans Duployan is available from [the Noto Duployan repository](
https://github.com/notofonts/duployan/releases) or from [Google Fonts](
https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Duployan). Noto Sans Duployan
Unjoined is not an official Noto font.

The “Testing” fonts add some private use characters to make testing more
convenient. They are only appropriate for testing the fonts during development.
Their PUA character assignments are unstable and may change at any time.

Each variant comes in both regular and bold, and both OTF and TTF.

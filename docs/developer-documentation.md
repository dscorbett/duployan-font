# Developer documentation

## Building

The prerequisites are:

* GNU Make
* Python 3.9 or later
* FontForge 20190801 with Python 3 extensions

To build Noto Sans Duployan, run:

```sh
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make NOTO=1
```

That will produce four fonts:

* fonts/ttf/unhinted/instance\_ttf/NotoSansDuployan-Regular.ttf
* fonts/ttf/unhinted/instance\_ttf/NotoSansDuployan-Bold.ttf
* fonts/otf/unhinted/instance\_otf/NotoSansDuployan-Regular.otf
* fonts/otf/unhinted/instance\_otf/NotoSansDuployan-Bold.otf

To only build one weight, append `STYLES=Regular` or `STYLES=Bold`.

To only build fonts with cubic BÃ©zier curves, append `SUFFIXES=otf`.

## Testing

The prerequisites are:

* HarfBuzz 2.7.3 or later

To test the fonts, run:

```sh
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
make NOTO=1 check
```

`STYLES` and `SUFFIXES` are also respected here.

## General remarks

These notes cover the languages used in _Kamloops Wawa_ and associated
publications: Chinook Jargon a.k.a. Chinook (chn), English (en), French (fr),
Halkomelem a.k.a. Stalo (hur), Latin (la), Okanagan (oka), Sechelt a.k.a.
Sheshel (sec), Shuswap (shs), and Thompson a.k.a. Ntlakapmah (thp), and likely
other Salishan languages.

Whenever it is practicable, especially at the beginning and end of words, the
above semi circle, or hook, turned _upwards or forward,_ will figure the third
sound \[_ē_]; it will be turned _downwards, or backward,_ to figure the first
and second sound \[_ā_ and _aī_]. (vol. IV no. 1 pp. 5–6)

A dash may with advantage replace the dot, to distinguish a _long_ sound. (vol.
IV no. 1 p. 6)

The semicircle may be turned “up” or “forward,” to represent “i” short or “e”
long; and it may be turned “down,” or “backwards,” to figure “e” short or “a”
long. This rule applies only when the hook is final, and in a few cases, as
illustrated in the exercises. (vol. V no. 1 p. 8)

The angle is avoided by turning the circle either side of the perpendicular.
(vol. V no. 1 p. 4)

The article _to_ is figured by turning the radiating circle _oo_ downwards,
while to represent _two_ or _too,_ the radiated circle is turned upwards. The
words _I_ and _eye_ have the same sound, yet the phonetic form can be written in
two different positions, to distinguish the one from the other. \[...] In _not_
the circle vowel is round and full, while in _note_ it is narrow and long.
\[...] Sometimes the position of the vowel is sufficient to indicate the
presence of an “h” in the word. For an example, “at” is written, with the “ah”
circle above, as in the first column,and “hat” with the same circle turned
downward, as in the second column&nbsp;: in that case there is no need of a dot
to designate the letter “h.” (vol. V no. 10 p. 212)

No. 21 p. 80, vol. V no. 3 p. 57, vol. V no. 4 pp. 76–79, vol. V no. 5 pp.
100–103, and vol. V no. 6 p. 125 have vowel orientation charts.

## Unclear characters

6, 7, 8, 9 (no. 20 p. 72)

* The code chart unifies them with M, N, J, S, but they are clearly smaller.

wou (no. 1 part 2 p. 3, no. 20 p. 72), owa, wia, wy, weoo (no. 20 p. 72)

* more compound vowels with “o”
* “Wy” is used to transcribe the English letter’s name. (no. 33 p. 3)
* “Wi” is used for the English “we”. (no. 34 p. 8)
* The general pattern is that a small vowel is written within a preceding large
  circle vowel; e.g. “ow a” (vol. III no. 2 p. 7). If a consonant follows the
  second vowel and that second vowel is not circle, as in the common word “wek”
  (ibid.), part of the consonant is written within the large circle too. This is
  true for “O A” in French and Romanian, and for all such sequences in _Kamloops
  Wawa_ regardless of language. I conclude that these are not characters, and WA
  etc. are mistakes in Unicode.
* Vol. IV no. 1 p. 6 explicitly calls these compound vowels out for used in
  English.
* Vol. V no. 1 p. 10 does the same, and furthermore calls them “samples \[...]
  to serve as a key for the writing of these and similar sounds”. This is
  clearly a productive rule.

ai (no. 24 p. 4, vol. IV no. 1 p. 5)

* upside-down “e” with dot below
* English

circled 4 (no. 58 p. 2)

* U+2463 CIRCLED DIGIT FOUR or markup?
* What does it represent?

cross on heart (no. 58 part 2 p. 6)

* represents the Feast of the Sacred Heart in the calendar

“e” and/or “i” with dot above (no. 63 p. 19)

punctuation like “×” and “+”

* line-initial crosses alternating between “×” and “+” (vol. III no. 3 p. 37)
* Chinese syllable separators (PBCW)

ellipse (vol. VI no. 3 p. 36)

* “o” in “note”, as opposed to “o” in “not”

kh (vol. IX no. 1 p. 7, CR p. 5) / kr (vol. IX no. 1 p. 64)

* “k” with dot right
* Probably the same character as “k” with the dot on the left. Only the presence
  of the dot matters, not its position. But how should it be represented in
  Unicode?

r̃ (vol. IX no. 1 p. 33)

* probably just a glyph variant of RH with the dots on the other side

initial hash-sign-like punctuation (“The Passion of J.-Ch. in Shushwap”, p. 27)

* contrasted with CHINOOK FULL STOP

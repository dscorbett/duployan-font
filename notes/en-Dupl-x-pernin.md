## General remarks

as an aid to securing the correct lengths of the various alphabetic signs, four
definite relative lengths are given, of which the _r_ stroke, about _one-eighth
of an inch_ in length, is taken as the unit (p. 4)

1. f, p, w, t, th, m, n, an, om, on, oÕûo, ≈´, kw, ng, ing. The length of r.
2. v, b, g, d, l, sm, st, sp, sk, kr, sw. Twice the length of r.
3. sn, gr, str, spr, skr, skw. Three times the length of r.
4. The curved strokes s, z; sh, zh; etc. are one and one-half times the length
   of r, or about three-sixteenths of an inch long; ≈≠ is also about
   three-sixteenths of an inch in length, while j, ch, are twice as long. i is
   one-half the length of r. (p. 4)

_R, l,_ are written at a slant of 25 degrees; the slant of _f, v, k, g,_ should
be about 40 degrees. An exception is made when _k, g,_ precede or follow _r, l,_
when they are written at a slant of 75 degrees. (p. 4)

the circles are traced to the _left_ of the down strokes, at the _beginning,
middle_ and _end_ of words, except when preceded by a vertical and followed by a
right oblique, as in the word _pack,_ õ∞Çõ±Åõ∞Ö. Circles are always traced _outside_
of angles. (p. 9)

The initial or first _up_ stroke in each word should begin on the line, and the
first _down_ stroke should rest on the line. If a circle or a horizontal stroke
precedes the first down stroke, the down stroke rests on the line. When a circle
precedes the up stroke or follows the down stroke, trace it beneath the line.
(p. 10)

When cognates, such as _t, d; l, r;_ etc., follow each other, they are separated
by a slight tick; (p. 14)

Trace the circles below horizontals at the beginning of words; above at the
middle; and above at the end of words, except before the up strokes _r_ and _l;_
(p. 14)

Trace the circles to the right of up strokes at the beginning, and to the left
in the middle, and at the end of words; (p. 15)

As conducive to speed, the sign for _r_ may be omitted after circles, and the
omission indicated by tracing the circles in a reverse position _to that in
which they would normally be written if the r did not occur;_ \[...] When _r_
occurs between two circles it may not be omitted. (p. 16)

the SMALL HALF CIRCLES \[...] should be traced so as to avoid angles as far as
possible, while retaining the general position of the sign. (p. 22)

The circles are traced _inside_ the curve of _m,_ except when followed by the
back strokes _k, g, oÕûo, ƒ´._ The circles are traced _outside_ the curve of _n_
when followed by _t, d, r, l, sh, j,_ and _inside_ when followed by all other
signs. Initial and final circles are traced inside of the curves _m, n._ (p. 23)

## Unclear characters

ng

* The code chart says it is U+1BC28 DUPLOYAN LETTER N S, but it looks more like
  U+1BC1A DUPLOYAN LETTER N to me.

we

* A turned ≈´ is the word sign for ‚Äúwe‚Äù.

oi

* The sign \[...] is strictly a combination of its two phonetic elements, _o i._
  While _oi_ may be reversed to avoid angles, and the curve traced in the
  direction of the following sign, it is usually traced in its natural position.
  (p. 36)
* Is that reversibility compatible with ‚Äúƒ≠‚Äù?

final s

* For the sake of brevity, final _s_ may be indicated by a dot on the end of the
  preceding sign. (p. 34)
* Final **s**, **z** and **es** may be indicated by making a dot on the end of
  the preceding sign, except when the preceding sign is a circle; (p. 46)
* The s dot may be used to make any word-sign plural, or to add s, z; (p. 55)
* Should a circle be contracted on, the dot to indicate the plural may be placed
  immediately _above_ the circle, and the contraction is then indicated as
  usual. (p. 104)

in, on

* The word-signs _in, on,_ should be written about one-half the length of _f_
  (p. 42)

x

* The sound **x** (or k s), whether initial, medial or final is represented by
  the short down stroke \[...]; it has the slant of **f** and is about one-third
  the length of that character. (p. 46)

≈≠

* Value: oÕùo
* Value: ≈≠
* The slant of the _oÕùo, ≈≠,_ stroke is about 20 degrees. (p. 17)

suppressed ≈≠

* Short u frequently proves an important vowel sound, especially in contracted
  outlines, and often makes perfectly legible an outline, which, lacking it,
  might prove puzzling; but it is found that in rapid writing considerable care
  must in some instances be exercised to form u joinings distinctly, and to
  obviate this, the writer may suppress the vowel, and indicate the suppression
  by a backward tick, or slight retracing of the end of the preceding sign,
  without raising the pencil, from which point he will begin the following sign,
  (p. 44)

tick r

* used in tr, dr, thr
* UTN #37 says this is encoded as r + VS1, but that sequence was not adopted.

punctuation

* paragraph, capitals, dash, laughter, applause, parentheses, hissing (p. 113)

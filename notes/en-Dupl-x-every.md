## General remarks

The circles may be either round or oval; they are GENERALLY written with a
righthand motion (p. 6)

the i stroke is said to be one space high; therefore i, r and the combination
signs are one space high; p, k, f, l, m, n, v, uh, st, sp, sk, krs are two
spaces high and t, th, s, sh, j are the same number of spaces in length; b, g,
v, ing, str, spr, skr, grs are three spaces high and d is their equal in length.
The small circle is made as small as possible and the large ones should be three
times the size of the smallest ah circle, so the aw circle will fall between the
two sizes. (p. 6)

beginners should observe the caution to always let the FIRST CONSONANT IN A WORD
REST ON THE LINE. (p. 6)

‚ÄúW‚Äù after ‚Äúk‚Äù or ‚Äúg‚Äù is a hook.

## General remarks

In cases where the sign following the contracted prefix is traced in a similar
direction to it, it is allowable to give the prefix an inclined form, taking
care, however, to observe its proper distance at either end. (p. 29)

Nasal vowels can attach to separated prefixes.

In the sequence “a a”, the second “a” is bigger and encircles the first. This
comes up in abbreviated phrases.

## Unclear characters

ā (p. 10)

“oh”, “owe”, “owing” (p. 11)

punctuation: dash, wonder, grief, laughter (p. 17)

joining dot

* “In writing words containing two vertical or two oblique consonant strokes,
  combinations such as _bab_ or _rer_, take an awkward form; and in order to
  preserve the symmetry of the writing, and at the same time promote rapidity,
  the first consonant may be written in full and the second indicated by a
  sudden pressure of the pen or pencil upon the end of the first consonant;
  [...] Similar consonants traced in a horizontal direction may be abbreviated
  in the same manner with advantage;” (p. 22)
* UTN #37 recommends using ZWJ between the two normal consonant letters. This is
  not a good idea.

l/r following l/r

* “Final _r_ may therefore be indicated by a slight upward tick inclining to the
  left; [...] and final _l_ by a slight upward tick to the right; [...]. These
  ticks must be made by the lightest possible drop of the pen, very short, so as
  not to be confounded with _i_, and written in a straight, inclined direction,
  so as not to be mistaken for any of the Nasal Combinations. When a word
  terminates in _l_ or _r_ which contains a similar sign either at the beginning
  or in the middle of the word, the final _l_ or _r_ may also be indicated by
  the tick sign; [...] If care is taken in the formation of the tick signs, they
  may also be introduced into words containing the upward strokes which do not
  terminate the word;” (p. 23)
* UTN #37 recommends variation sequences, which the UTC did not accept.

“above”, “below” (p. 32)

* lines above resp. below

an, en vs. on, un (p. 42)

* Both use U+1BCA1 SHORTHAND FORMAT CONTINUING OVERLAP but the latter two
  overlap closer to the end of the contracted word than the former.

little dash (p. 44)

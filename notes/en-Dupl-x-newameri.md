## General remarks

Every other letter, when doubled, must be ticked. (p. 20)

If the alphabetic form of L or R were rigorously adhered to when joining
these letters to M or N (and _vice versa_), very awkward angles would
result. These are altogether avoided by using the following forms, in
which every combination of these letters becomes an easily written
curve:— (p. 24)

The circle-vowels are to be written generally on the inside of curves,
on the upper side of horizontal letters (M and N), and on the right-hand
side of perpendicular or slanting letters. When a straight line is
joined to a curve, that joining is to be preferred that requires the
fewest pen-strokes, and looks the neatest. (p. 59)

In a few words (like _divided_), when the entire outline would encroach
on the lower line, the last syllable may be written alongside. (p. 59)

## Unclear characters

semicircles (pp. 10, 21)

* There seems to be but one character for long E, long I, and short I,
  which may be written not avoiding angles.
* To avoid unnecessary angles these characters are “tucked into” an open
  loop in joining with most of the consonants. (p. 10)
* The semicircle S is bigger than the vowels, and may be unifiable with
  the digits 6–9, except that it is orienting.

long and short U and OO (p. 11)

oi, ow (p. 13)

* sequences of semicircle vowels and “ă” or new code points?

All the consonants, except L and R, M and N, may be partially shaded to
imply an added R, (p. 14)

_M_ and _L_ are \[...] partially shaded to imply _T_. The same holds for
_N_ and _R_. (p. 16)

M, S, D, V, and L may be made double-length simply to double the letter;
(p. 20)

The so-called nasal sound of N, by which it is pronounced ING, is
written by slightly lengthening G; and if the sign be still further
lengthened so as to equal the space of two G’s, the combination INGK is
formed. (p. 22)

The very short light stroke representing “the” is purely arbitrary; it
should make a sharp angle with the word to which it is joined. (p. 30)

“in” (p. 35)

* U+1BC4A DUPLOYAN LETTER UI rotated 45° clockwise, or a small U+1BC54
  DUPLOYAN LETTER U N

6, 7, 8, 9 (p. 57)

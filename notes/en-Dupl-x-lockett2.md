## General remarks

When the hook vowel comes before or after a curve, it is not always convenient
to make a proper hook inside the curve, therefore the vowel can be shown by a
small portion of the preceding or succeeding letter being carried into the
curve, thus forming an imperfect hook, (p. 4)

_i_ (long) and _oi_ being the only disjoined vowels, all that is necessary to
know, is, what is meant by writing it _before_ or _after_ a consonant:—
_Before_ is to the _left_ of descending, and _s_, _r_ and _x_ (up) characters,
and _above_ horizontal ones, \[...] _After_ means to the right of descending and
_s_, _r_, _x_ (up) characters, and _below_ horizontal ones, (pp. 4–5)

The affixes are disjoined from the preceding portion of the word, by writing
them _through_ or _“full-butt” against it_, but distinguishable as the affix,

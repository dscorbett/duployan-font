[Lichtentag Paragon Shorthand: A Vast Improvement in the Art of Shorthand](https://books.google.com/books?id=9DUuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR1)<br>
A. Lichtentag

## General remarks

Paragon Shorthand is quite different from other Duployan shorthands. Many of the
basic letters have idiosyncratic values. Still, the glyphs themselves, the
orienting rules for vowels, and the aversion to angles are obviously Duployan in
nature, so it is reasonable to unify it with Duployan in Unicode.

## General remarks

As explained, vowels may only be thickened to add ‚Äúr‚Äù at the end of
monosyllables. Only the downward portion of the circle need be thickened. (p. 8)

When two straight strokes come together in the same direction, make a slight
break between them (without, however, lifting the pen from the paper) (p. 9)

When a circle or oval vowel comes between two strokes going in _different_
directions, it is placed outside of the angle formed by the junction of the two
straight strokes. (p. 9)

The oval vowel is written in line with the preceding stroke (p. 9)

The down slope of k and g is the same from ‚Äúb‚Äù as the up slope l and r is from
‚Äúd.‚Äù (p. 13)

Circles and hooks are turned inside of curves for their normal positions \[...]
In a few cases where inconvenient to turn the hook inside it may be turned
outside \[...] When a circle comes between two curves it is turned inside the
first curve \[...] When a hook comes between two curves the hook and second
curve are traced together with one motion \[...] When a hook comes between a
straight stroke and a curve, the hook and curve are traced together with one
motion \[...] In certain combinations the hook is indicated by projecting part
of the curve into the straight stroke, as: leas õ∞Üõ±éõ∞ú green õ∞äõ≤ùõ±éõ∞ö (p. 19)

Circles and hooks are turned inside of quadrants for their normal positions (p.
24)

It is expedient to write the ‚Äúup‚Äù quadrants at a slightly greater angle from the
vertical than the corresponding ‚Äúdown‚Äù letters (p. 23)

Initial small quadrant signs must make the sharpest possible angle with the sign
which follows \[...]. Medial or final small quadrants must make the sharpest
possible angle with the preceding sign (p. 27)

When ‚Äúr‚Äù follows \[...] the only signs thickened to prefix ‚Äúr‚Äù \[...], the ‚Äúr‚Äù
is indicated by placing the vowel outside the curve. (p. 37)

In combinations such as õ∞úõ±áõ∞Ç the ‚Äúr‚Äù is indicated by producing an angle (p. 37)

‚ÄúR‚Äù precedes or follows an _initial_ vowel reversed in position before any
straight line (RR&A p. 10)

‚ÄúR‚Äù follows _terminal_ vowels reversed in position (RR&A p. 11)

## General remarks

Because some curve consonants go from right to left, a stenogram may end up
crossing itself, as in “spoil” (SP WA L) on page 16.

Reversed circle vowels represent those vowels adjacent to omitted D/S/T.

The cardinal numbers should always be isolated from the words, but the ordinal
numbers are placed either over or under the stenograms to which they are
related: (p. 64)

## General remarks

Because some curve consonants go from right to left, a stenogram may end up
crossing itself, as in “spoil” (SP WA L) on page 16.

Reversed circle vowels represent those vowels adjacent to omitted D/S/T.

The cardinal numbers should always be isolated from the words, but the ordinal
numbers are placed either over or under the stenograms to which they are
related: (p. 64)

## Unclear characters

an, en, in, un, am, em, im, um

* These are all arcs with different isolated forms and diacritics but the same
  rotatable skeleton. The -m series is the same as the -n series, except that
  angles are encouraged. Unicode does not have anything like this; it says to
  use U+1BC62 or U+1BC64, but both of them have “invariant direction upwards”.

small M

* mis-, -alism, -ism, -sim, -tism, -gram

small N

* -deousness, -geousness, -tiousness, -scionness
* -ingness
* -[less]ness

small S

* sub-, subs-, sur-, super-

reversed UH

* -cians, -sions, -tions

## General remarks

THE _long_ SOUND OF _a_ OR, IN FACT, OF ANY VOWEL, IS DISTINGUISHED BY A HEAVY
DOT; ITS _short_ SOUND BEING DISTINGUISHED BY A LIGHT DOT. THE SOUND _ah_ IS
REPRESENTED BY A SHORT TICK, (p. 5)

Place the dot near vowel sign without regard to position. (p. 7)

The long sound of _oo_ is distinguished by a tick (p. 9)

When a horizontal letter commences a word it must be written above the line, if
followed by a sloping or perpendicular letter, as ‚Äúgate‚Äù õ∞àõ±Åõ∞Ç A primary consonant
character must not be written _through_ the line. But the _whole_ of a
consonant, when joined to another, may sometimes fall below the line, (p. 8)

It is seen that when a letter is lengthened, the part added, falls below the
line \[...] When _l_ and _r_ are lengthened they are commenced below the line.
(p. 14)

## Unclear characters

How should the light dot, heavy dot, and tick, which have no particular
position, be encoded?

Should the ‚Äúo‚Äù with dot be encoded as OW or with the solution to the previous
question?

i, oi, ow (p. 12)

reversed ‚Äúo‚Äù (p. 7)

bl, dl, kl, gl, rl (p. 14)

* The existing Unicode triads like T, D, D S have size ratios 1:2:3 in the code
  chart. These would have size 4.

‚Äúbeyond‚Äù (p. 18)

‚Äúhow‚Äù, ‚Äúhowever‚Äù (p. 19)

lengthened long and short curves (p. 20)

* Unicode only provides two curve lengths. ABC Shorthand requires two more.

y (p. 21)

* turned LONG U

‚Äúyou‚Äù (pp, 12, 23)

* LONG U or EE

-able, -ably (p. 36)

* Should these be unified with the short line consonants?

self, selves, -bility, -ality (p. 38)

* circle, large circle, or dot centered below consonant

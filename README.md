# Duployan font

A Unicode font for Duployan.

This is a project to improve support of Unicode Duployan.
Currently, that means creating Noto Sans Duployan.
After that, it will involve researching all Duployan variants and creating a
font supporting them all, ultimately leading to a Unicode proposal to expand
its Duployan repertoire.

Notes on various systems are in the notes directory.
Those are not part of the Noto Sans Duployan project.

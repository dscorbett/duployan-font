    everything about the shape that is not right at the end or very
    close to it.

    Attributes:
        angle: The angle at which the notional pen is traveling at the
            endpoint. If this is ``None``, that indicates that no context
            information is available, and the other fields must all have

        minor: Whether the fields of this context are only applicable to
            a very small bit near the end of the shape, suggesting that
            whatever implications they would normally apply to do not
            necessarily hold. This is currently only used for U+1BC50

            its endpoints like a line letter, it is not, and therefore
            does not induce a tick in adjacent letters.
        ignorable_for_topography: Whether the shape can appear in an
            orienting sequence. In an orienting sequence, one character
            determines how the rest are oriented, and the rest are
            ignored by the main topographical phases.

            diphthong ligature.

    should be shared between functions.

    Every key in the underlying mapping has a prefix. This view allows
    the user to omit the prefix for all normal operations (getting,
    setting, etc.) and the prefix is added internally.

    There are two possible prefixes in a given view’s underlying
    mapping. One is derived from the name of a given function plus
    ``".."``. The other is ``"global.."``. Only the former is
    automatically added by this view. If a key has the global prefix,
    the view passes it through to the underlying mapping unchanged;
    otherwise, a key passed to a method of a view must not contain
    ``".."``.
